# Publishing Results

The Semiconductor Test Library does not directly process or evaluate test results. It instead passes published test results to be separate results handler. The library currently leverages the TestStand Semiconductor Module (TSM) to act its results handler, where the test results are evaluated against limits at the TestStand level. Refer to the TSM documentation linked below for more information.
