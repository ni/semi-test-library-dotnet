# Adding Using Statements

Ensure that you have added the appropriate namespaces as using statements to your code.

For example, when using the DCPower instruments, make sure you are using the following using statements in your code:

```C#
using SemiconductorTestLibrary.InstrumentAbstraction;
using SemiconductorTestLibrary.InstrumentAbstraction.DCPower;
```
