# Note

- Any new files added to this folder will be ignored by the git tools. This is because we have an entry in the .gitignore file located at the root folder of this repository.  
- If you need the files to be added to the repo, then first edit the `.gitignore` file in the repo root. i.e. comment the line that has this entry `/**/Supporting Materials/*` with help of this # in front of the line.
Then commit your files and then revert the  `.gitignore` file changes.
