This directory contains Code Snippet style examples.

**What is a Code Snippet style example?**
- Code Snippet style examples demonstrate how to use specific API methods or implement coding concepts using an assumed context. 
- Different use cases, scenarios, and concepts are broken down into individual static methods within separate static class files organized by high-level categories, such a instrument abstraction and data abstraction.
- The context required to run the example is implied and not directly provided by the example itself. Rather, it is documented as an assumption within the example method summary and/or via comments in-line with the code statements.
- The example method code is not expected to run standalone outside of the implied context.
