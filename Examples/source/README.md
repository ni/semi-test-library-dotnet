This directory contains examples for how to use the Semiconductor Test Library.
There are different styles of examples available, as described in the table below

 **Example Type** | **Description** |
|- |- |
| Code Snippet Style | <br>Code Snippet style examples demonstrate how to use specific API methods or implement coding concepts using an assumed context. <br>Different use cases, scenarios, and concepts are broken down into individual static methods within separate static class files organized by high-level categories, such a instrument abstraction and data abstraction.<br>The context required to run the example is implied and not directly provided by the example itself. Rather, it is documented as an assumption within the example method summary and/or via comments in-line with the code statements.<br>The example method code is not expected to run standalone outside of the implied context. |
| Standalone Style | <br>Standalone style examples demonstrate how to program instrumentation or implement code-level concepts.<br>Any assumed context required to run or understand the example is documented within an accompanying README.md file and via comments in-line with the code statements and method summaries.<br>It can be executed standalone, outside of the TestStand Sequence Editor, if the criteria defined by the provided context is met.<br>Runs in offline mode with simulated hardware or with actual hardware depending on the criteria defined by the provided context. |
| Sequence Style | <br>Sequence style examples demonstrate how to program instrumentation or implement code-level or sequence-level concepts within the context of an STS test sequence.<br>There is a single sequence file for each high-level example.<br>Within a given example sequence there may be multiple sub-sequences, steps with code-modules to cover the various use cases, scenarios, or high-level concepts.<br>Any assumed context required to run or understand the example is documented within an accompanying README.md file and via comments within the sequence file and in-line with the code statements.<br>They are intended to be run from within the TestStand Sequence Editor (assuming the criteria defined by the provided context is met). <br>Runs both with actual hardware and in offline mode with simulated hardware.<br>Code modules are not expected to run standalone or be executable outside of TestStand. |
| Test Program Style | <br>Test Program style examples demonstrate a mock test program for testing a certain DUT type. <br>Accompanied by a README.md file that documents the DUT type, assumptions, and any requirements.<br>Contains fully documented code implementations (every test method has code-level summary documentation).<br>Runs in offline mode with simulated hardware. |
