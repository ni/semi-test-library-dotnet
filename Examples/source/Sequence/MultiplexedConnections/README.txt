# Multiplexed Connections Examples

Note that the Semiconductor Test Library does not currently support interfacing with Multiplexed Connections defined in a pin map.

If your pin map contains Multiplexed Connections you should leverage the TestStand Semiconductor Module's Code Module API alongside the Semiconductor Test Library. 
This example walks you through what that may look like for a hypothetical DMM Multiplexed to mulitple sites.
