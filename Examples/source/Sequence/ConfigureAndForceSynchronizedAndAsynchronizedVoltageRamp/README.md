# ConfigureAndForceSynchronizedAndAsynchronizedVoltageRamp Sequence Example

This example shows how to run the different force voltage using ramps.

### Prerequisites

1. If you want to use the example you must have the following software installed:
   - STS Software 24.5.0 or later
2. To run the example you must also have:
   - A NI-DCPower instrument named SMU_4163_C1_S04 as defined in MAX.
   - TestStand configured to use the Batch process model.

> **NOTE**
>
> You can view the example sequence file in the TestStand Sequence Editor and C# code source files in Visual Studio or any text editor without meeting the #2 requirement.
> To run the example though, you must have the required instruments physically installed in your system or simulated using Offline Mode.
>
> Complete the following steps to simulate the instruments in Offline Mode:
>
> 1. Open the sequence file (.seq) in the TestStand Sequence Editor.
> 2. Click the Enable Offline Mode button on the TSM toolbar. To run the test sequence, click the Start/Resume Lot button on the TSM toolbar.
> 3. Click the Disable Offline Mode button to return to the default TSM behavior.

## Using the Example

Complete the following steps to use this example. You can also run this example in offline mode to see it in action.

3. You must meet all the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) to run the test program. To run the test program, click the **Start/Resume Lot** button on the TSM toolbar.
