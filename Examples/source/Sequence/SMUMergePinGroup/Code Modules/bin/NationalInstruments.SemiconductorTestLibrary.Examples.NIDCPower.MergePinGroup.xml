            <summary>
            This class provides example methods to demonstrate how to use the MergePinGroup and UnmergePinGroup 
            DCPower Instrument Abstraction methods from the Semiconductor Test Library.
            These methods can be used to merge DUT pins together to output higher current.
            These methods are only supported under the following conditions:
            1. The pin map must define a pin group to contain all the pins that are to be merged together.
            2. Each pin in the pin group must be mapped to an SMU channels of same module for a given site.
            3. The SMU module must support the niDCPower Merged Channels feature.
            For example: PXIe-4147, PXIe-4162, and PXIe-4163.
            4. The pins are physically connected externally on the application load board, either in a fixed configuration or via relays.
            The example methods of this class demonstrate how relay configurations can be applied 
            to ensures the SMUs channels are physically connected in parallel before the MergePinGroup operation,
            and subsequently disconnected after the UnmergePinGroup operation.
