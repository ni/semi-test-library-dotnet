            <summary>
            This class contains example of how to use the MergePinGroup and UnmergePinGroup functions in the
            Instrument Abstractions from the Semiconductor Test Library. Specifically, how to merge Pin Groups
            for forcing high current and measure voltage for pins mapped to DCPower Instruments from same module.
            Later unmerge the pin group to disconnect the pins and instrumentation after the test is complete.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Note that only few DCPower Instruments support merging feature which includes PXIe-4147, PXIe-4162 and PXIe-4163.
            This also requires the pinmap to define the pingroup to contain all the pins to be merged and each
            pin is mapped to SMU channels of same module.
            This example assumes:
             - Relay configurations to be applied before the merging operation ensures the SMUs channels are connected
             in parallel configuration and disconnect after unmerging.
