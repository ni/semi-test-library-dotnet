# Custom Instrument Examples

Note that the Semiconductor Test Library does not currently support interfacing with Custom Instruments defined in a pin map.

If your pin map contains Custom Instruments you should leverage the TestStand Semiconductor Module's Code Module API alongside the Semiconductor Test Library. 
This example walks you through what that may look like to implement your own support to work with a hypothetical Custom Instrument.
