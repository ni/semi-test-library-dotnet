# Semiconductor Test Library - SMU Merge PinGroup Example 

## What does this example show?
Demonstrates the use of the SMU MergePinGroup and UnmergePinGroup methods provided by the Semiconductor Test Library to merge and unmerge smu pins defined as pingroup in pinmap file and
source more current than individual channel can provide from a dcpower instrument.

## What are the prerequisites for running this example?
- DCPower Driver software
- .NET Framework 4.0 or 4.5.
- A compatible multichannel SMU instrument (e.g., NI PXIe-4147, NI PXIe-4162, or NI PXIe-4163).
