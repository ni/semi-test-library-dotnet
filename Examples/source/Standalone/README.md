This directory contains Standalone style examples.

**What is a Standalone style example?**
- Standalone style examples demonstrate how to program instrumentation or implement code-level concepts.
- Any assumed context required to run or understand the example is documented within an accompanying README.md file and via comments in-line with the code statements and method summaries.
- It can be executed standalone, outside of the TestStand Sequence Editor, if the criteria defined by the provided context is met.
- Runs in offline mode with simulated hardware or with actual hardware depending on the criteria defined by the provided context.
