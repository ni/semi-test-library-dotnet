# Supported Instrument Types

The Semiconductor Test Library supports the core set of modular instruments commonly used within the NI [Semiconductor Test System (STS)](https://www.ni.com/sts). Refer to the following table for the instrument types currently supported by the library.

**Table 1:** Supported Instrument Types
