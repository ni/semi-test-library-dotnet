# Parallelization Methods

The Semiconductor Test Library provides extension methods for abstracting parallel for loops that are required to iterate over each of the various instrument sessions within a given pin sessions bundle.

- Note that you can use the Parallelization methods with any class that inherits from the `ISessionsBundle` interface, such as the `DCPowerSessionsBundle` class.
- You can use these methods to perform one or more driver operations across each instrument session associated with the pin(s) queried.
- Overloads allow you to specify whether an operation is to be performed across each session or across each pin and site.
- You should use these methods only when writing low-level driver calls to implement instrument capabilities not yet exposed by the Semiconductor Test Library.
