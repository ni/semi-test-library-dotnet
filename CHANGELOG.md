  - **Data Abstraction**
    - New Bitwise Math Operations Added `PinSiteData<T>`
      - `ShiftLeft(int count)`
        - Return Type: `PinSiteData<T>`
        - Description: Shifts the value to the left by the specified bit count, for each element, per site. The count must be positive. This method is supported only when the underlying data type of the `PinSiteData<T>` object, `T`, is an integer type.
      - `ShiftRight(int count)`
        - Return Type: `PinSiteData<T>`
        - Description: Shifts the value to the right by the specified bit count, for each element, per site. The count must be positive. This method is supported only when the underlying data type of the `PinSiteData<T>` object, `T`, is an integer type.

- ### Changed
  
  - Math Operations methods now support most common numeric data types with improved exceptions for catching unsupported types and input array size mismatches.
  - Math Operations methods now support scalar input values when the underlying type, `T`, of the `SiteData<T>` or `PinSiteData<T>` object is an array type.
    - For `PinSiteData<T>` objects, the scalar value will be applied to all elements in the array, across each pin and site.
    - For `SiteData<T>` objects, the scalar value will be applied to all elements in the array, across each site.
  - `Utilities.TryDeterminePowerLineFrequency` updated to now support OfflineMode.
  - `TestStandSteps.ContinuityTest` modified to correctly accept negative current level values.
  - CSProject files for TestStandSteps and Extensions now exclude net48 path from being included as a folder within the project, which was could cause build issues for contributors in certain situations.
