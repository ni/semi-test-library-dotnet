You can learn more about the Source Link feature [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/library-guidance/sourcelink).

- ### Changed

  - **Data Abstraction**
    - Math Operations methods now check and report the following error
      - When the underlying type, `T`, of the `SiteData` or `PinSiteData` object being operated on is an array, the `TResult` must also be an array of equal dimensions as the underlying type, `T`.

    - Fix a DAQmx input tasks read issue that measurements of channels for all sites are returned even though some sites are actually filtered out.
    - Fix `DCPower.Measure.FetchMeasurement` to include current measurement instead of returning voltage measurement twice.
  - **TestStandSteps**
    - `SetupNIDigitalPatternInstrumentation` now provides a new boolean input `applySourceWaveformData` to control whether to apply the data in waveform files to source waveforms.
  - **Documentation & Examples**

      - For `SiteData<T>` objects, the scalar value will be applied to all elements in the array, across each site.

      - `PinSiteData<double[]> ReadMultiPoint(this DMMSessionsBundle sessionsBundle, int numberOfPoints, double maximumTimeInMilliseconds)`
      - `PinSiteData<double[]> FetchMultiPoint(this DMMSessionsBundle sessionsBundle, int numberOfPoints, double maximumTimeInMilliseconds)`

  - **TestStandSteps**
    - `ContinuityTest` modified to correctly accept negative current level values.
    - `FilterPinsOrPinGroups` removed as a private method from ContinuityTest.cs, the `ContinuityTest` method now references the new public implementation for this method in the common `Utilities` class: `FilterPinsOrPinGroups`
    - `LeakageTest` now forces 0V on all pins at start of test and after measuring. It also now ensures all pins are forced to the specified voltage level before measuring current. Finally, it will now disable the output of all pins at the end of the test. The method summary documentation has also been updated to reflect this change.
    - `ForceDcCurrent` now correctly applies the specified voltage limit symmetrically for PPMU pins and has updated method summary documentation to reflect this change.
    - `ForceCurrentMeasureVoltage` now correctly applies symmetric voltage limits for PPMU pins and has updated method summary documentation to reflect this change.
  - **Common**
    - `Utilities.TryDeterminePowerLineFrequency` updated to now support OfflineMode.
    - `Publish.PublishResults` extension methods now correctly publish site-agnostic data. Site-agnostic data has no specific site number associated with it (i.e. -1), such as with measurements for SystemPins.
  - **GitHub Repo**
    - CSProject files for TestStandSteps and Extensions now exclude net48 path from being included as a folder within the project, which could cause build issues for contributors in certain situations.
