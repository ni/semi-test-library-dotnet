## 24.5.1 - 2024-10-31

- ### Added
  
  - **Data Abstraction**
    - New Bitwise Math Operations Added `PinSiteData<T>`
      - `ShiftLeft(int count)`
        - Return Type: `PinSiteData<T>`
        - Description: Shifts the value to the left (`<<`) by the specified bit count, for each element, per site. The count must be positive. This method is supported only when the underlying data type of the `PinSiteData<T>` object, `T`, is an integer type.
      - `ShiftRight(int count)`
        - Return Type: `PinSiteData<T>`
        - Description: Shifts the value to the right (`>>`) by the specified bit count, for each element, per site. The count must be positive. This method is supported only when the underlying data type of the `PinSiteData<T>` object, `T`, is an integer type.

This method is supported only when the underlying data type of the `PinSiteData<T>` object, `T`, is an integer type. Additionally, the type of the input value, `TOther`, can be either a scalar or an array, but the underlying type of the array must match that of the `PinSiteData<T>` object, `T`, and it cannot be of a greater number of dimension (i.e. `TOther` cannot be 2D when `T` is 1D).
